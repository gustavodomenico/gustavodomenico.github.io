## How to Set Up MkDocs Locally

To work with this project locally, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed on your system. Then, install MkDocs and the required dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
1. **Install MkDocs and dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material pymdown-extensions
   ```
   You may also need to install any other dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file if present:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   mkdocs --version
   ```
   You should see the installed MkDocs version.

Now you can use the `build` and `serve` scripts as described below to build or serve the documentation.

## Building and Serving the Site

This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the Material theme. Two scripts are provided for convenience:

- **`build` script**: Builds the static site for deployment, using the MkDocs structure. It will generate the site for both Portuguese and English.
- **`serve` script**: Serves the site locally for development. You can specify the language (`pt` or `en`) to preview the documentation in that language.

### Example Usage

To build the site:
```bash
./build
```

To serve the site locally in Portuguese:
```bash
./server pt
```

To serve the site locally in English:
```bash
./server en
```

The language can be selected using the menu located next to the search box at the top of the page.
