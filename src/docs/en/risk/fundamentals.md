**FX Risk** is the uncertainty of financial loss caused by changes in the exchange rate, that is, the risk that the financial result of a future operation will be different from what was planned because **the currency price changed**.

Note that although FX risk is related to the financial aspect of the institution, it impacts the entire strategic planning of corporations.

## Volatility

The main source of FX risk is **volatility**, which is the measure of the intensity and frequency with which the price of an asset (in this case, the exchange rate) rises and falls over a given period—usually rapidly, sharply, and significantly. Obviously, the higher the volatility, the greater the inherent risk of the asset in question.

The main consequences of a scenario of high exchange rate volatility are:

* **Destroys predictability**: Prevents corporate planning for all operations involving the FX context.
* **Increases the cost of protection (hedge)**: Costs to use hedge instruments become more expensive.
* **Drives away investors**: Less predictable environments can lead to capital flight from the country by foreign investors.

Remember, while a high or low dollar has its winners and losers, **high volatility is detrimental to the economy as a whole**, as it creates an environment of uncertainty that hinders business and long-term investments.

## FX Exposure

FX exposure is the extent to which a **company's finances** (e.g., cash flows) are **vulnerable** to **exchange rate fluctuations**. Any company (or individual) that has revenue, expenses, or investments in **foreign currency** has some level of FX exposure.

### Exposure vs Risk

It is common to confuse FX exposure with FX risk, but the difference is very simple. Exposure is the **fact** of having assets and values in foreign currency, while FX risk is the **possibility** of financial loss due to this exposure.

## Case Study

"Cafés do Sul Ltda.", a Brazilian company, closes a large contract to sell coffee beans to a coffee shop chain in Europe:

* Contract Value: €500,000 (five hundred thousand euros)
* Payment Condition: The European client will pay the invoice in 60 days.
* Euro exchange rate on the contract day: R$ 5.60
* Revenue projection: All its cost, expense, and profit margin planning was based on the projected revenue of R$ 2,800,000 (500,000 x 5.60).

Note that from the signing of the contract until the day the money is received, the exporter has an **FX exposure of €500,000** and its main **risk** is the **fall of the Euro**.

#### Scenario A: The Risk Materializes (Euro Falls)

* On the payment date, due to economic factors, the Euro falls to R$ 5.30.
* The company receives the €500,000 and, when converting them to Reais, obtains R$ 2,650,000.
* Financial Impact: The company had a **loss of R$ 150,000** compared to its initial projection.

#### Scenario B: An Unexpected Gain (Euro Rises)

* On the payment date, the Euro rises to R$ 5.80.
* When converting the €500,000, the company receives R$ 2,900,000.
* Financial Impact: The company had a **gain of R$ 100,000** compared to what was planned.

#### Conclusion

Although scenario B seems great for the company, both scenarios show the central problem related to FX risk: **uncertainty**. It is to eliminate uncertainty that companies resort to derivatives for FX hedging in the next section.
