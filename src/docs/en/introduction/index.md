Foreign exchange, or the currency market, is the main place where the currencies of different countries are exchanged. Considered the largest money market in the world, its existence is vital for the global economy. After all, without it, companies could not import or export, and tourists could not travel converting money. This market operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, in a global electronic network, with banks and large companies as the main participants. In it, currency prices change constantly, influenced by various economic and political factors.

## Relevance of the Dollar

The US Dollar (USD) dominates the global scene as the main world reserve currency. In addition, it serves as a reference for most international trade and investments, including essential commodities. The US financial markets, being the largest and most liquid, attract many investments, resulting in many securities and loans being denominated in dollars. Its high liquidity not only allows large transaction volumes at low cost, but the USD also acts as a vehicle currency, facilitating exchange between other currencies. The economic and political stability of the US, together with a strong network effect, consolidates its central position in the global financial system.

## Foreign Exchange in Brazil

In Brazil, the foreign exchange market is the system where the Real (BRL) is exchanged for foreign currencies. Strictly regulated by the Central Bank (BACEN), it is organized into segments such as the commercial (for trade and finance) and tourism (for individuals). Although the US dollar dominates transactions, other currencies are also traded.
