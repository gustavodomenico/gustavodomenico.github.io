To understand the current functioning of the foreign exchange market in Brazil, it is necessary to analyze the transition from the previous regulatory structure to the **new legal framework (Law No. 14,286/2021)**. This section details the characteristics of the previous system and the principles underlying the current legislation.

## Regulatory Structure Prior to Law 14,286/2021

The previous regulatory environment was characterized by a set of complex and restrictive rules, reflecting a past economic context of greater control over capital flows.

* **Fragmented and Bureaucratic Legislation**: Foreign exchange regulation was not consolidated, consisting of more than 40 laws and a large volume of infra-legal regulations. This fragmentation resulted in **high complexity**, **legal uncertainty**, and **high operational costs** for companies and financial institutions.

* **Centrality and Rigidity of the Exchange Contract**: The system was centered on the "exchange contract". Every purchase or sale of foreign currency required the execution of this standardized document, which served as a supervisory instrument for the Central Bank and contained more than 150 classification codes, representing the main point of **bureaucracy in the system**.

* **Operational Restrictions and Inefficiencies**: The control structure imposed practical barriersâ€”companies with international operations, for example, were often forced to carry out **inefficient financial movements**, such as "round-trip exchange" (internalizing revenues to then externalize them), which generated additional costs with spreads and taxes.

## Principles and Guidelines of the New Foreign Exchange Framework

Law No. 14,286/2021 instituted a change in regulatory philosophy, focusing on efficiency, simplification, and international integration. Its pillars are:

* **Legal Consolidation and Simplification**: The New Framework consolidated **legislation into a single text**, providing greater clarity and legal certainty.

* **Debureaucratization and Cost Reduction**: The law aimed to eliminate unnecessary procedures. The main advance was the **flexibility of the requirement for the rigid exchange contract**, allowing the formalization of operations to be simpler.

* **Operational Freedom and Responsibility of Agents**: The regulatory model shifted from a prescriptive system to one based on principles, giving more **freedom to agents** and increasing the demands on their compliance programs.

* **Alignment with International Standards**: The law was designed to align Brazil with **OECD practices** (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), with the aim of reducing friction for foreign investors and facilitating the country's insertion into global value chains.

* **Promotion of Innovation and Competition**: The more flexible regulatory environment was structured to lower entry barriers for new business models, especially in the **fintech sector**.

## Comparative Table

The table below summarizes some of the most relevant changes for the daily lives of companies and individuals.

| Operation Aspect | Before the New Framework (Until 2022) | After the New Framework (From 2023) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operation Formalization** | Mandatory execution of a "Rigid Exchange Contract" for almost all operations. | Freedom of formalization between parties (email, invoice, simple contract). Registration with the Central Bank is done in a simplified manner by the institution. |
| **Use of Export Revenues**| General rule required internalization of funds (closing the exchange). Compensation of credits abroad was restricted and complex. | Explicit permission for **private compensation**: exporters can use their revenues abroad to pay their (or group) obligations abroad. |
| **Cash Limit for Travel** | Allowed to carry the equivalent of **R$ 10,000.00** in foreign currency, in cash, when entering or leaving Brazil. | Limit increased and dollarized to the equivalent of **US$ 10,000.00** (US dollars), offering more predictability. |
| **FX between Individuals**| Prohibited. Buying and selling foreign currency was restricted to authorized financial institutions. | Allowed for occasional and non-professional operations, with a **limit of up to US$ 500.00** (or equivalent) per transaction. |
| **Non-Resident Accounts in Reais** | Restricted use, with complex rules for movement. | Rules equated to those of resident accounts, allowing use for payments of any nature and facilitating the operation of payment fintechs. |
| **Advance Payment for Imports**| Restricted time limits (e.g., up to 180 days before shipment). | Greater flexibility. Deadlines are freely defined as negotiated between importer and exporter. |
| **Foreign Direct Investment**| Distinct and more bureaucratic rules for registering foreign investment and external credit. | Unified treatment as "foreign capital", simplifying the registration and movement of resources for investment purposes in the country. |
